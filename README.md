# Clarivate

Source code and tests can be found inside code/ directory.

The entry point of the program is file code/main.py. The tests are in code/test_holiday_parser.py file. I used python versions 3.6.8 and 3.7.2. The external modules can be found inside requirements.txt.

Small note: The process of writing to sqlite database will append the data, not overwrite it.
